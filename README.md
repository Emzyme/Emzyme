- 👋 Hi, I’m @Emzyme
- 👀 I’m interested in; Statistics, Chemistry, Cooking and, Distroying the patriachy 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning; How to code in R- I'm a noob. I'm also learning about astrophysics because I think it's kinda dope.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with R code (or chemistry because I'm doing my thesis in theoretical reaction mechanics)  
- 📫 How to reach me? Please don't. Said with love.
